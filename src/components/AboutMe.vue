            You can call me by my nickname, <b>Mak</b>. I am a <b>Systems Engineer</b>,
            a <b>Web Developer</b>, and I have been an <b>IT Professor</b> at the City of

             I developed an interest in creating functional websites while I was still studying in college,
            and after I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
            I also enjoy exploring new technology trends from time to time.

            As a systems engineer, I have designed and implemented robust systems that meet the needs of
            diverse clients. My role as a web developer has allowed me to create user-friendly and visually
            appealing websites that provide an excellent user experience.

            My time as an IT professor has honed my ability to communicate complex technical concepts
            effectively, helping students and colleagues alike to understand and apply their knowledge.
